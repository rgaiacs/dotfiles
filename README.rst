	   POP 	                          IMAP
========== ============================== ==============================
Storage    Your computer. When using POP, Riseup Server. IMAP leaves 
           you typically download all     all messages on the server.
           your mail to your computer and Another way to think of this
           remove it from the riseup.net  is that an IMAP mail client
           servers.                       provides a view of the
                                          existing data stored on the
                                          server.

           you predominately check your   many clients and keep them
           mail from the same computer.   in sync.
Speed      Faster, since everything is    Slower, since the mail
           just downloaded once to your   client will query the server
           computer.                      repeatedly.
Quota      You never need to worry about  You will have limited quota. 
           quota if your client is
           configured to delete messages
           on the server after
           downloading.
