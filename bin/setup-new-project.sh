# create NEWS file
#
# The package should have a file named NEWS which contains a list of
# user-visible changes worth mentioning. In each new release, add items to the
# front of the file and identify the version they pertain to. Donâ€™t discard old
# items; leave them in the file after the newer items. This way, a user
# upgrading from any previous version can see what is new.
touch NEWS

# create ChangeLog file
#
# Keep a change log to describe all the changes made to program source files.
# The purpose of this is so that people investigating bugs in the future will
# know about the changes that might have introduced the bug. Often a new bug can
# be found by looking at what was recently changed. More importantly, change
# logs can help you eliminate conceptual inconsistencies between different parts
# of a program, by giving you a history of how the conflicting concepts arose
# and who they came from.
#
# This have been deprecated because of control version system.
#touch ChangeLog

# create README file
#
# This is the first file an installer should look at and fully read after
# unpacking a distribution and prior to configuring it. All other documentation
# files should be referred to, directly or indirectly, from the README file.

touch AUTHORS

# create THANKS file
#
# In Emacs, thanks are not published for the people who just send bug fixes.
# There are too many of them. The only people thanked are those who do larger
# amounts of work. However, if you find it is OK to thank them all, that is OK
# (letter from Richard, 1995-09-20).
