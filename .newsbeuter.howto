This is the newsbeuter how to.

Instalation
===========

You can use

    # apt-get install newsbeuter

Set up steps
============

To add feeds to newsbeuter, you can add URLs to the configuration file
`$HOME/.newsbeuter/urls`. Open the file with your favorite text
editor and add the URLs, one per line:

    http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss
    http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml

If you need to add URLs that have restricted access via username/password,
simply provide the username/password in the following way:

http://username:password@hostname.domain.tld/feed.rss

After add the feeds, init newsbeuter with

    $ newsbeuter

Several aspects of newsbeuterâ€™s behaviour can be configured via a
configuration file, by default `$HOME/.newsbeuter/config`.

Advanced Features
=================

Usually, the ~/.newsbeuter/urls file contains one RSS feed URL per line. To
assign a tag to an RSS feed, simply attach it as a single word, separated by
blanks such as space or tab. If the tag needs to contain spaces, you must use
quotes (") around the tag (see example below). An example \~/.newsbeuter/urls
file may look like this:

    http://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html interesting conspiracy news "cool stuff"
    http://rss.orf.at/news.xml news orf
    http://www.heise.de/newsticker/heise.rdf news interesting

Get Feed url
============

I write some Python scripts to get the url for the some sites. You can
found this scripts at `.newsbeuter` and they are:

#. `newsbeuter-fb.py`: This is a script to get the Facebook's time line
updates for some profile. The origin of this script are found at
http://ooiks.com/blog/how-to-2/get-facebook-fans-page-news-feed-rss-feed-atom-feed.

#. `newsbeuter-ytb.py`: This is a script to get the uploads for some
channel of Youtube. The origin of this script are found at http://www.youtube.com/t/rss_feeds and https://gdata.youtube.com/demo/index.html.
